- verines
	add predefined names
	delete verine check
	add errors to error_messages.txt
	implement verines in execution.rs
	verine in verine e.g. LET A = | GET FROM A AT | GET FROM A LEN | |
	note: not allowed to use multiple verine; e.g. IF | GET FROM A AT 0 | == | GET FROM B AT 0 | START
												   --> because tokenizer takes last and first verine together then second last and second and so on!

- maybe print help -> show where the error is
	e.g. > PRINT "HELLo"
		 -------------+

- indentation
	e.g. > IF 12 < 24 START
		 	> BLA BLA
