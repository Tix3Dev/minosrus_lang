- verines
	implement verines in execution.rs
	change verines in tokenizer; new thing that isn' checked with recursion: LET A = | 1 - 2 + 3 * 4 |

- maybe print help -> e.g. when token order is wrong print the right and show where the error is
	e.g. > PRINT "HELLo"
		 -------------+

- indentation
	e.g. > IF 12 < 24 START
		 	> BLA BLA

- change operators (e.g. < is missing; split into comparing and +-*/ etc)
