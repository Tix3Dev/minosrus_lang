- verines
	add predefined names
	note: not allowed to use multiple verine; e.g. IF | GET FROM A AT 0 | == | GET FROM B AT 0 | START
		--> because tokenizer takes last and first verine together then second last and second and so on!
	this error:
		> LET A = |1+|5*5||
		thread 'main' panicked at 'begin <= end (16 <= 15) when slicing `LET A = |1+|5*5||
		`', src/execution/tokenizer.rs:157:138
		note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

- maybe print help -> show where the error is
	e.g. > PRINT "HELLO"
		 -------------+

- indentation
	e.g. > IF 12 < 24 START
		 	> BLA BLA
