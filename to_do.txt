- fix weird behavior:
	```
	LET A = 12
	IF A == 12 START
		PRINT "HELLOOOOOOO"
		ELSE
		PRINT "HELLO"
		END
	```
	and this one which only exists when executing it from_file
	```
	LET B = [12, 32]
	LET A = | B |
	```

- fix while loop bug (verine that is in account for incrementing the index gets evaluated just once)
