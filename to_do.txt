- check strings for valid letters

- predefined name POP and PUSH are not great. Better way:
	PUSH 121 ONTO A
	POP FROM A
	INSERT 121 INTO A AT 0
	REMOVE FROM A AT 1

- || thing (update notes):
	return stuff: LET A = | DO FUNC |
	array indexing: LET A = | GET FROM A AT 0 |

- not priority: new predefined name: somthing with LEN
