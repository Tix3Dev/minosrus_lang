- verines - wait a bit - i had enough - someone will contribute :)
	add predefined names
	note: not allowed to use multiple verine; e.g. IF | GET FROM A AT 0 | == | GET FROM B AT 0 | START
		--> because tokenizer takes last and first verine together then second last and second and so on!
	this error:
		> LET A = |1+|5*5||
		thread 'main' panicked at 'begin <= end (16 <= 15) when slicing `LET A = |1+|5*5||
		`', src/execution/tokenizer.rs:251:138
		note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
	this strange thing:
		> LET A = |12+1|
		["LET", "A", "=", "0"]
		[("PREDEFINED_NAME", String("LET")), ("VARIABLE/FUNCTION_NAME", String("A")), ("EQUAL_SIGN", String("=")), ("INTEGER", String("0"))]

( - maybe print help -> show where the error is
	e.g. > PRINT "HELLO"
		 -------------+
)

- indentation
	e.g. > IF 12 < 24 START
		 	> BLA BLA

- show all error messages??

- implement test cases (tokenizing)

- evaluate the values of variables so that this would work
	LET A = "MOIN"
	IF A == "LOL" START
  also printing the value of a variable doesn't work (PRINT A)

- remove the unreachable! except for let a = { unreachable! }

- make this match statements look less awful xD
