( - maybe print help -> show where the error is
	e.g. > PRINT "HELLO"
		 -------------+
)

( - implement test cases (tokenizing) )

- big problem: IF [12, 323, 45, 1252] == "LOL" START panics because of the array BECAUSE KEY/VALUE ORDER DOESN'T GET CHECKED
	-> is it necessary to hard code every possibility and evaluate it after check (without changing to much (AST's))?
		-> would be at least less confusing because currently if we write LET A = IF (throws an error) it says it can only be a string, integer or vec but it doesn't say variable/function name which it theoretically should
		
		-> if we change it, let's do it the checking part a function so they can be reused for ELIF which needs order check 

- what about ELIF

- arrays that can contain different types -> empty arrays are possible
