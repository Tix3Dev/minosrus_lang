( - maybe print help -> show where the error is
	e.g. > PRINT "HELLO"
		 -------------+
)

( - implement test cases (tokenizing) )

- warning when code block isn't closed

- maybe smth like this also for execution part, problem is that line in is a token_collection : println!("- ERROR OCCURED ON LINE NR. {}: '{}'", line_nr, line);

- floats!!!

- maybe in installing part on README say that: install with cargo build --release and then execute it ./minosrus_lang
and say that it's only tested on linux and instructions are for linux
