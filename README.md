# minosrus_lang

**DISCLAIMER: This project is still in development.**

A simple interpreter for my own programming language called minosrus lang. 

It's inspired by BASIC but also by new languages like Rust.

In the future the interpreter will (eventually) be used for an OS.

It's my first project in Rust.
