Predefined names:
- e.g. LET or TRUE
- Semantics: Predefined keywords 


Operators:
- e.g. = or + or ==
- Semantics: In charge for arithmetic operations and for conditions


Variable/function names:
- e.g. FOO but not 1337
- Semantics: Custom words for saving stuff

Strings:
- e.g. "HELLO WORLD?"
- Semantics: Data type
			 Single characters or multiple characters

Integers:
- e.g. 352 or -72727
- Semantics: Data type
			 Numbers which are always signed and 32 bit -> i32

Arrays:
- e.g. [21, -211, 3828]
- Semantics: Multiple strings or integers of the same type; dynamic
- Manipulating: PUSH 121 ONTO A
- Manipulating: POP FROM A
- Manipulating: INSERT 121 INTO A AT 0
- Manipulating: REMOVE FROM A AT 1
- Note: Can't print an array; just elements

Comments:
- e.g. # HELLO, I AM A COMMENT
- Semantics: The # is always at the beginning of a line; everything after it gets ignored

Verines:
- e.g. | 12 ** 2 + 6 |
- Semantics: The inner part of a verine gets evaluated and will have one value.
- Note: You can use this everywhere where you would normally write a string or an integer.

Some words about code blocks:
- Every line with indentation is only syntax check; once you fully go back (indentation = 0), there are 3 cases:
	- Case 1: It's a function -> nothing wil be executed until you call it with DO
	- Case 2: The condition for IF/WHILE is true -> execution
	- Case 3: The condition for IF/WHILE is false -> no execution
